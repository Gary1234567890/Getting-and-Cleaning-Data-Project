# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Steps to work on this course project

1. Download and unzip the data source as per the instructions and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
2. Put run_analysis.R in the root folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
3. Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_data.txt in your working directory.

## What it does

There are 5 parts:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Dependencies

1. run_analysis.R file will help you to install the dependencies automatically. It depends on reshape2 and data.table.
